# 25.Reverse Nodes in k-Group

## Problem Description

- Given the `head` of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return *the modified list*.

  `k` is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

  You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

   

  **Example 1:**
  
  ![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse_ex1.jpg)
  
  ```
  Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
  Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
  ```
  
  **Example 2:**
  
  ![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/reverse_ex2.jpg)
  
  ```
  Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
  Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
  ```
  
   
  
  **Constraints:**
  
  - The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
  - `1 <= k <= n <= 5000`
  - `0 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Solution

Iteratively, first calculate how many times you need to reverse to easily connect at the end, and then reverse one by one. Note that there are many pointers involved here, so it's best to solve this problem by drawing a diagram.

## key Points

* first calculate how many times you need to reverse
* attention on head and tail

## Code

``` py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy=ListNode(-1,head)
        h=dummy
        t=dummy
        p=head
        i=p
        count=0
        while i:
            i=i.next
            count+=1
        n=count//k
        time=0
        while p:
            if time<n:
                t=p
                k1=0 
                pre=None
                while p and k1<k:
                    i=p
                    p=p.next
                    h.next=i
                    i.next=pre
                    pre=i
                    k1+=1

                t.next=p
                h=t
                time+=1
            else:
                break
        return dummy.next
```
