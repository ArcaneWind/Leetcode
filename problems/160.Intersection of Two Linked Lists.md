## Problem Description

- Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return *the node at which the two lists intersect*. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

  For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

  The test cases are generated such that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

  **Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

  **Custom Judge:**

  The inputs to the **judge** are given as follows (your program is **not** given these inputs):

  - `intersectVal` - The value of the node where the intersection occurs. This is `0` if there is no intersected node.
  - `listA` - The first linked list.
  - `listB` - The second linked list.
  - `skipA` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listA` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.
  - `skipB` - The number of nodes to skip ahead in `listB` (starting from the head) to get to the intersected node.

  The judge will then create the linked structure based on these inputs and pass the two heads, `headA` and `headB` to your program. If you correctly return the intersected node, then your solution will be **accepted**.

   

  **Example 1:**

  ![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_1_1.png)

  ```
  Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
  Output: Intersected at '8'
  Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
  From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
  - Note that the intersected node's value is not 1 because the nodes with value 1 in A and B (2nd node in A and 3rd node in B) are different node references. In other words, they point to two different locations in memory, while the nodes with value 8 in A and B (3rd node in A and 4th node in B) point to the same location in memory.
  ```

  **Example 2:**

  ![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_2.png)

  ```
  Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
  Output: Intersected at '2'
  Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
  From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
  ```

  **Example 3:**

  ![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_3.png)

  ```
  Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
  Output: No intersection
  Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
  Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
  ```

   

  **Constraints:**

  - The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
  - The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
  - `1 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
  - `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
  - `0 <= skipA < m`
  - `0 <= skipB < n`
  - `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
  - `intersectVal == listA[skipA] == listB[skipB]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

## Solution1

We need to find a way for pointers a and b to reach the intersection at the same time. By subtracting the lengths of the two linked lists, we can obtain the difference in length of the non-intersecting parts. Then, using fast and slow pointers with a constant interval, they can arrive at the same time.

## key Points

* use two pointers with a constant interval
* calculate the interval

## Code1

``` py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        pa=headA
        pb=headB
        p1=headA
        p2=headB
        a=0
        b=0
        while pa:
            pa=pa.next
            a+=1
        while pb:
            pb=pb.next
            b+=1
        k=a-b
        if k>=0:
            while k>0:
                p1=p1.next
                k-=1
        else:
            while k<0:
                p2=p2.next
                k+=1
        while p1!=p2:
            p1=p1.next
            p2=p2.next

        return p1
```

## Solution2

The total length of two intersecting linked lists is fixed, so we can have pointers a and b traverse their own lists and then switch to the other list. Eventually, they will meet at the intersection point.

## key Points

* Each pointer traverses both linked lists.

``` py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    # p1 指向 A 链表头结点，p2 指向 B 链表头结点
    p1, p2 = headA, headB
    while p1 != p2:
        # p1 走一步，如果走到 A 链表末尾，转到 B 链表
        if p1 == None:
            p1 = headB
        else:
            p1 = p1.next
        # p2 走一步，如果走到 B 链表末尾，转到 A 链表
        if p2 == None:
            p2 = headA
        else:
            p2 = p2.next
    return p1
```
