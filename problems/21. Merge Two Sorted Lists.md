# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

## Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/description/

## Problem Description

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`.

Merge the two lists into one **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return *the head of the merged linked list*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)

```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

## Solution

A classic two-pointer linked list problem where two pointers move according to different conditions. By changing the conditions and distances of the movement, more complex problems can be solved. This problem also requires the use of a dummy head node to simplify the code, otherwise, it will be necessary to handle the case where p is null separately.

## key Points

* use two pointers
* create a dummy head node

## Code

``` py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, list1: Optional[ListNode], list2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not list1:
            return list2
        if not list2:
            return list1

        h=ListNode(-1)
        p=h
        p1=list1
        p2=list2
        while p1 or p2:
            if p1 and not p2:
                p.next=p1
                break
            if p2 and not p1:
                p.next=p2
                break
            if p1.val>p2.val:
                p.next=p2
                p=p.next
                p2=p2.next
            else:
                p.next=p1
                p=p.next
                p1=p1.next

        return h.next
```
