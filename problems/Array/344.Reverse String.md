# 344.Reverse String

## Problem Description

- Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

  You must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with `O(1)` extra memory.

   

  **Example 1:**

  ```
  Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
  Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
  ```

  **Example 2:**

  ```
  Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
  Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
  ```

   

  **Constraints:**

  - `1 <= s.length <= 105`
  - `s[i]` is a [printable ascii character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

## Solution

Use left and right pointers to modify the array in place.

## key Points

* Pay attention to the loop termination condition

## Code

``` py
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        left=0
        right=len(s)-1
        while left<right:
            t=s[left]
            s[left]=s[right]
            s[right]=t
            left+=1
            right-=1
```
