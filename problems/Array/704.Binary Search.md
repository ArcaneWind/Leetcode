## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer `target`, write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-104 < nums[i], target < 104`
- All the integers in `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

## Solution

Use the binary search method

## key Points

* The value of right determines whether the search interval is closed or open. If right=len(nums)-1, it means the interval is [left,right], if right=len(nums), it means the interval is [left,right)
* Whether the termination condition in the while loop is written as < or <= depends on whether it is an open or closed interval.
* The values that need to be updated for left and right also depend on the interval.

## Code

``` py
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left=0 
        right=len(nums)-1
        mid=-1
        while left<=right:
            mid=left+(right-left)//2
            if nums[mid]==target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid]<target:
                left=mid+1
            else:
                right=mid-1
        
        return -1
```
