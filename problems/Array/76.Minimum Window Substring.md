## Problem Description

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return *the **minimum window*** 

***substring\***

 *of* `s` *such that every character in* `t` *(**including duplicates**) is included in the window*. If there is no such substring, return *the empty string* `""`.



The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 105`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

 

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

## Solution

To solve the problem, employ a sliding window approach. Initially, move the right pointer to expand the window until it encompasses the required string. Next, shift the left pointer to contract the window until it no longer contains the necessary string. Throughout this process, continuously update the minimum length of the window.

## key Points

* We can utilize a number and two dictionaries to determine if the window contains the required string. The number records how many characters meet the criteria.

## Code

``` py
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        from collections import defaultdict
        l=0
        r=0
        valid=0
        start=0
        length=float('inf')
        characters=defaultdict(int)
        window=defaultdict(int)
        for i in t:
            characters[i]+=1
        while r<len(s):
            c=s[r]
            r+=1
            if c in characters:
                window[c]+=1
                if window[c]==characters[c]:
                    valid+=1
            while valid==len(characters):
                if r-l<length:
                    start=l
                    length=r-l

                d=s[l]
                l +=1
                if d in characters:
                    if window[d]==characters[d]:
                        valid-=1
                    window[d]-=1
        if length==float('inf'):
            return ''
        else:
            return s[start:start+length]



        
```
