# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

## Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/description/

## Problem Description

Given a string `s`, return *the longest* 

*palindromic* substring in `s`. 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consist of only digits and English letters.

## Solution

Be careful sometimes we need to solve both odd and even problems. Check each point and expand outward to see if it forms a palindrome.

                    right+=1
                    left-=1
                    n+=2
                if n>length:
                    length=n
                    start=left+1

        return s[start:start+length]
