## Problem Description

- Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return *the middle node of the linked list*.

  If there are two middle nodes, return **the second middle** node.

   

  **Example 1:**

  ![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist1.jpg)

  ```
  Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
  Output: [3,4,5]
  Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.
  ```

  **Example 2:**

  ![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/23/lc-midlist2.jpg)

  ```
  Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
  Output: [4,5,6]
  Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.
  ```

   

  **Constraints:**

  - The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.
  - `1 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution

Fast and slow pointers, one moves at twice the speed of the other.

## key Points

* use two pointers with different speed
* The ratio of speeds determines at which dividing point to stop.

## Code

``` py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def middleNode(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        first=head
        second=head
        while second and second.next:
            first=first.next
            second=second.next.next

        return first
```
