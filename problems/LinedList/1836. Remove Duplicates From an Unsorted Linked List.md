# 1836. Remove Duplicates From an Unsorted Linked List

## Link

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-an-unsorted-linked-list/description/

## Problem Description

Given the `head` of a linked list, find all the values that appear **more than once** in the list and delete the nodes that have any of those values.

Return *the linked list after the deletions.*

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/21/tmp-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,2]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: 2 appears twice in the linked list, so all 2's should be deleted. After deleting all 2's, we are left with [1,3].
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/21/tmp-linked-list-1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [2,1,1,2]
Output: []
Explanation: 2 and 1 both appear twice. All the elements should be deleted.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/21/tmp-linked-list-2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [3,2,2,1,3,2,4]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: 3 appears twice and 2 appears three times. After deleting all 3's and 2's, we are left with [1,4].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 105]`
- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`

## Solution

Use slow and fast pointers. Use two cyclies.

## key Points

* Use slow and fast pointers.


## Code

``` py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicatesUnsorted(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        d={}
        dummy=ListNode(-1)
        dummy.next=head
        pre=dummy
        p1=head
        p=head
        while p1:
            if p1.val not in d:
                d[p1.val]=1
            else:
                d[p1.val]+=1
            p1=p1.next
        while p:
            if d[p.val]==1:
                p=p.next
                pre=pre.next
            else:
                pre.next=p.next
                p=p.next
        return dummy.next


```
