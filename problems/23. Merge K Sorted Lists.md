## Problem Description

- You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

  *Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.*

   

  **Example 1:**

  ```
  Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
  Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]
  Explanation: The linked-lists are:
  [
    1->4->5,
    1->3->4,
    2->6
  ]
  merging them into one sorted list:
  1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
  ```

  **Example 2:**

  ```
  Input: lists = []
  Output: []
  ```

  **Example 3:**

  ```
  Input: lists = [[]]
  Output: []
  ```

   

  **Constraints:**

  - `k == lists.length`
  - `0 <= k <= 104`
  - `0 <= lists[i].length <= 500`
  - `-104 <= lists[i][j] <= 104`
  - `lists[i]` is sorted in **ascending order**.
  - The sum of `lists[i].length` will not exceed `104`.

## Solution

The solution is similar to merging two sorted linked lists, but it requires considering how to find the smallest node most efficiently. Therefore, a min heap is used for implementation. Python has a `heapq` module, which allows popping the smallest value each time, and then pushing the next node into the heap until the heap is empty.

## key Points

* use min heap
* Optional[ListNode] means return None or ListNode, so do not return []
* When comparing sizes using tuples, it's important to note that if the first value is the same, the next value will be compared. Since `ListNode` cannot be compared, it's necessary to add an index to provide additional criteria for comparison.

## Code

``` py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not lists:
            return None
        dummy=ListNode(-1)
        p=dummy
        pq=[]
        for index,h in enumerate(lists):
            if h:
                heapq.heappush(pq,(h.val,index,h))
        
        while pq:
            v,i,node=heapq.heappop(pq)
            p.next=node
            if node.next:
                heapq.heappush(pq,(node.next.val,i,node.next))
            p=p.next
        return dummy.next
```

***Complexity Analysis***

**Time: *O*(*N*log*k*) where k is the number of linked lists.**
**Space: O(n)**
